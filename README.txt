Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further

The hamlet repository we are working on contains five files. In Git, it’s common to change many files, add those files to the staging area, and commit them to a repository in a single commit.

For example, say you want to change the character “LARRY” to “LAERTES” in the script. The name currently appears in two files. After you change the name in both files, you could add the changed files to the staging area with:

git add filename_1 filename_2
Note the word filename above refers to the name of the file you are adding to the staging area, such as scene-3.txt.
